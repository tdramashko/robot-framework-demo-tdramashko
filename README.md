# 🚀 SDET Automation Showcase: Robot Framework E2E Testing

This repository demonstrates my capabilities as a **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** by implementing a robust, maintainable, and scalable end-to-end (E2E) automation suite using the **Robot Framework**.

The project adheres strictly to modern automation best practices, providing a clear illustration of technical proficiency in creating reliable and readable test automation.

## ✨ Key Skills Demonstrated

| Feature | Description | SDET Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robot Framework** | Utilizes the BDD-style, English-like syntax for high test readability. | Promotes **collaboration** between QA, Dev, and Product teams. |
| **Page Object Model (POM)** | Structured organization of element locators and page-specific actions. | Ensures **maintainability** and **reusability** of test components. |
| **Keyword-Driven Testing** | Custom, high-level keywords abstract away implementation details. | Facilitates creation of complex flows with minimal code changes. |
| **Robust Reporting** | Leverages built-in HTML reports and logs for quick test analysis. | Essential for **debugging** and providing status updates in CI/CD. |
| **Environment Setup** | Clear `requirements.txt` and project structure for easy deployment. | **CI/CD Readiness** and team adoption. |
